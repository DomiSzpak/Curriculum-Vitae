                   <p>My name is Dominika and I recently graduated Coders Lab's bootcamp
                   where I have learned skills required to start a job as Front-End Developer.
                   I was always interested in aesthetics, understanding how things work and how to improve them.
                   Therefore I decided to change my career path from finance to programming
                   and I am currently looking for a job where I can develop my professional skills.
                   </p>
